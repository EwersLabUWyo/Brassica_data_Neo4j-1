**The purpose of this file is to record Cypher scripts used by the
author, Mallory Lai, during the course of importing
Brassica RNA-Seq data into Neo4j.**  

LazyWebCypher was used to run multi-statement scripts.

# Importation:

    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (g:Gene) ASSERT g.id IS UNIQUE;  
    
    USING PERIODIC COMMIT 100  
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM   
    'file:///full_Neo4j.csv' AS line  
    
    MERGE  (g:Gene {id: line.Gene})  
    MERGE (c:Count {count: TOINT(line.Count)})  
    MERGE (tm:Treatment {trmt: (line.Treatment)})  
    MERGE (t:Tissue {tissue: (line.Tissue)})  
    CREATE (g)-[:TRANSCRIBES_TO {replicate: TOINT(line.Replicate)}]->(c)  
    CREATE (tm)-[:TREATMENT]->(g)  

This doesn't place constraint on relationship. Redundant relationships exist.   
    
The following code doesn't work: 

    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (g:Gene) ASSERT g.id IS UNIQUE;    
    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (c:Count) ASSERT c.count IS UNIQUE;    
    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (tm:Treatment) ASSERT tm.trmt IS UNIQUE;    
    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (t:Tissue) ASSERT t.type IS UNIQUE;    

    USING PERIODIC COMMIT 100    
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM     
    'file:///full_Neo4j.csv' AS line    

    CREATE  (g:Gene {id: line.Gene})    
    CREATE (c:Count {count: TOINT(line.Count)})    
    CREATE (tm:Treatment {trmt: (line.Treatment)})    
    CREATE (t:Tissue {type: (line.Tissue)})    

    
Interestingly, this returns the wrong number of rows: 

    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (g:Gene) ASSERT g.id IS UNIQUE;  

    USING PERIODIC COMMIT 100  
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM   
    'file:///full_Neo4j.csv' AS line  

    CREATE  (g:Gene {id: line.Gene})  

This returns 26,998 genes instead of 27,023. That's short 25 genes. 

This returns the correct number of rows: 

    USING PERIODIC COMMIT 100  
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM   
    'file:///full_Neo4j.csv' AS line  

    MERGE  (g:Gene {id: line.Gene})
